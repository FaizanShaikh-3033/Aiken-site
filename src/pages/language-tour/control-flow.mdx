# Control flow

## Blocks

Every block in Aiken is an expression. All expressions in the block are
executed, and the result of the last expression is returned.

```aiken
let value: Bool = {
    "Hello"
    42 + 12
    False
}

value == False
```

Expression blocks can be used instead of parenthesis to change the precedence of operations.

```aiken
let celsius = { fahrenheit - 32 } * 5 / 9
```

## Piping

| Operator   | Precedence |
| :-----:    | ---------- |
| `\|>{:ak}` |          0 |

Aiken provides syntax for passing the result of one function to the arguments
of another function: the pipe operator (`|>`). This is similar in functionality
to the same operator in Elixir, Elm or F#.

The pipe operator allows you to chain function calls without using a lot of
parenthesis and nesting. For a simple example, consider the following
implementation of an imaginary `string.reverse` in Aiken:

```aiken
string_builder.to_string(string_builder.reverse(string_builder.from_string(string)))
```

This can be expressed more naturally using the pipe operator, eliminating the
need to track parenthesis closure.

```aiken
string
  |> string_builder.from_string
  |> string_builder.reverse
  |> string_builder.to_string
```

Each line of this expression applies the function to the result of the previous
line. This works easily because each of these functions takes only one
argument. Syntax is available to substitute specific arguments of functions
that take more than one argument; for more, look below in the section "Function
capturing".

## Looping through recursion

Aiken is a functional programming language, and as such, doesn't provide any
control flow for loops. Instead, Aiken embraces recursion. A recursive function
is a function that calls itself in its own definition. And similarly, a
recursive type is a type that is defined in terms of itself.

Let's see an example for both.

```aiken
type MyList<a> {
  Empty
  Prepend(a, MyList<a>)
}

fn length(xs: MyList<a>) -> Int {
  when xs is {
    Empty -> 0
    Prepend(_head, tail) -> 1 + length(tail)
  }
}

length(Prepend(1, Prepend(2, Prepend(3, Empty)))) // == 3
```

Here we artificially define a custom `MyList{:ak}` type which represents a linked
list. And we define a function over it that computes its length. In both cases,
you can see how it is crucial that there exist a terminal case.

Recursion is extremely powerful, in particular on an execution environment like
Plutus on Cardano. Abuse it.

## If-Else

Pattern matching on a `Bool{:ak}` value is discouraged and `if *condition* else`
expressions should be use instead.

```aiken
let some_bool = True

if some_bool {
  "It's true!"
} else {
  "It's not true."
}
```

Note that, while it may look like an imperative instruction: if this then do
that or else do that, it is in fact one single expression. This means, in
particular, that the return types of both branches have to match.

Incidentally, you can have as many conditional `else/if{:ak}` branches as you need:

```aiken
fn fibonacci(n: Int) -> Int {
  if n == 0 {
    0
  } else if n == 1 {
    1
  } else {
    fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1)
  }
}
```

## Fail & Todo

Sometimes, you need to halt the evaluation of your program because you've
reached a case that is considered invalid or simply because you haven't yet
finished developing some logic. Aiken provides two convenient keywords for
that: `fail{:ak}` and `todo{:ak}`.

When encountered, both will halt the evaluation of your program which will be
considered failed. They differ in their semantic i.e. how the compiler
behaves towards them.

In fact, `todo{:ak}` will trigger warnings at compilation to remind you of those
unfinished parts. `fail{:ak}` will not, as it is assumed to be a desired break
point. Note that the warning also includes the expected type of the expression
that needs to replace the `todo{:ak}`. This can be a useful way of asking the
compiler what type is needed if you are ever unsure.

Let's see an example for both to grasp the difference:

```aiken
fn favourite_number() -> Int {
  // The type annotations says this returns an Int, but we don't need
  // to implement it yet.
  todo
}

fn expect_some_value(opt: Option<a>) -> a {
  when opt is {
    Some(a) -> a
    None -> fail // We want this to fail when we encounter 'None'.
  }
}
```

When this code is built Aiken will type check and compile the code to ensure it
is valid, and the `todo{:ak}` or `fail{:ak}` will be replaced with code that crashes the
program if that function is run.

### Giving a reason

A `String{:ak}` message can be given as a form of documentation. The message
will be traced when the `todo{:ak}` or `fail{:ak}` code is evaluated. Note that
this is likely the only place where you will encounter the type `String{:ak}`
and this is because the message needs to be printable -- unlike most
`ByteArray{:ak}` which are often plain gibberish.

```aiken
fn favourite_number() -> Int {
  todo @"Believe in the you that believes in yourself!"
}

fn expect_some_value(opt: Option<a>) -> a {
  when opt is {
    Some(a) -> a
    None -> fail @"Option has no value"
  }
}
```

## Expect

`expect{:ak}` is a special assignment keyword which works like `let{:ak}`, but allows to
perform some potentially unsafe conversions. There are two main use cases for
it:

### Non-exhaustive pattern-matching

In cases where you have a value of a type that has multiple constructor
variants, but are only truly interested in one of the possible variants as
outcomes (i.e. any other outcomes invalidate the program), then `expect{:ak}`
is the perfect tool. Consider the `Option{:ak}` type in the following example:

```aiken
let x = Some(42)

// As a pattern-match
let y = when x is {
  None -> fail
  Some(y) -> y
}

// Using expect
expect Some(y) = x
```

As you can see, `expect{:ak}` works like a non-exhaustive pattern-match. The
difference being that it is instructed to crash the entire program in case
where the right-hand side wouldn't have the expected shape. It signals to the
compiler that in this particular place, it is acceptable to not be exhaustive.

<Callout type="info">
  This may seem like a bad practice from the traditional world, but remember that
  Aiken is used in a smart contract context where there's often no room for error
  handling. Either the data has the expected form, or the entire contract fails.
</Callout>

### Casting from `Data` into a custom type

Another crucial use of `expect{:ak}` is to turn some opaque `Data{:ak}` into a
concrete representation. In the context of a Cardano smart contract, we can
encounter `Data{:ak}` in various places although in general it's most likely when
dealing with the datums attached to outputs.

Often, we do expect a specific structure for some given datum, and so being able
to safely relay those assumptions in the validators comes in handy.

The syntax is identical to the other use case, but it requires an explicit type
annotation.

```aiken
type MyDatum {
  foo: Int,
  bar: ByteArray,
}

fn to_my_datum(data: Data) -> MyDatum {
  expect my_datum: MyDatum = data
  my_datum
}
```

Note that this conversion will fail if the given `Data{:ak}` isn't actually a valid
representation of the target type `MyDatum{:ak}`. The primary use-case here is for
instantiating script contexts, datums and redeemers provided to scripts in a
serialized form.

## Soft casting with `if/is`

The `expect{:ak}` keyword works well in cases where failing is an option. But there are situations, like for example when recursively traversing elements of a list, where it isn't acceptable. The `if *expr* is *pattern*{:ak}` therefore comes into play when you need to fallback in case a right-hand side value doesn't have the right shape instead of failing loudly. It can also be particularly handy when you simply don't know the expected type of an opaque `Data{:ak}` and need to try several alternatives.

`if *expr* is *pattern*{:ak}` There is an extension to if expressions to be able to attempt casting but without returning an error by using the provided else instead.

```aiken
type Foo {
  foo: Int
}

type Bar {
  Buzz(Int)
  Bazz(Int)
}

fn soft_casting(d: Data, x: Data) -> Bool {
  // with no pattern provided
  if d is Foo {
    d.foo == 1
  // with a pattern
  } else if d is Bazz(y): Bar {
    y == 1
  // with a pattern
  } else if x is Buzz(y): Bar {
    y == 2
  } else {
    False
  }
}
```

Like `expect{:ak}`, patterns can be used for either type-casting or pattern-matching on a single pattern. And like `expect{:ak}`, it can also introduce new identifiers in scope. As shown, in the second and third branch, we introduce a `y{:ak}` variable that is only available within those branches. Note that the use of `if/is{:ak}` is discourage in situation where no type-casting is necessary: just use `when/is{:ak}`.

A final `else{:ak}` is always required and acts like a wildcard / catch-all case to handle any remaining pattern or casting not explicitly covered by any of the previous branch.
