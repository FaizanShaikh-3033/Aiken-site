# Installation Instructions

## Compiler & toolkit

### From `aikup` (Linux & MacOS only)

First, install `aikup`: a basic utility tool to download and manage Aiken's
pre-compiled executables:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://install.aiken-lang.org | bash
```

Then, simply run:

```
aikup
```

<Callout type="info">
  `aikup` alone installs the latest version available. You can install specific
  versions by specifying a version number. For usage instructions, use `aikup
  --help`.
