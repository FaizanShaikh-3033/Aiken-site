# What I wish I knew when exploring Cardano

This documentation is a collection of tips and secret knowledge that may be
useful in your Cardano journey. Some may never be useful to you or only useful
in the distant future. Yet, we hope that if we can save someone a few hours of
debugging and hunting down rabbits in bottomless holes, we have accomplished
our mission.

## CBOR / CDDL

Pretty much everything in Cardano that requires serialization is done using a a
structured binary format called [CBOR](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949).
Think of it as JSON but for binary data. You don't have to be an expert in CBOR
to work on Cardano, but being familiar with the notation can be useful
especially for troubleshooting low-level stuff.

There are two specific areas worth knowing:

- CDDL, which is a specification meta-language for CBOR. It's used to describe
  how some data is encoded into bytes. In particular, the Cardano ledger
  maintains [a CDDL specification of all the Cardano
  objects](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/81548171f2cd336714bb0425640a6553c46aa09e/eras/babbage/test-suite/cddl-files/babbage.cddl)
  that have to be serialized on-chain. Transaction serialization, for example, is
  entirely specified in this document. This specification is generally **the**
  source of truth for many other tools.

- CBOR diagnostic provides a more human-readable, JSON-like syntax that
  is handy for debugging. We explain CBOR diagnostic in more detail in the
  [Troubleshooting](/language-tour/troubleshooting#cbor-diagnostic) section.

A well-known tool for debugging CBOR is [cbor.me](https://cbor.me); there are
also numerous command-line utilities in various languages.

## Byron Addresses

Cardano has two kinds of addresses, which are called by different names
depending on who you ask. Prior to the introduction of the Shelley era,
addresses looked vastly different than what they look like today.

For example: `Ae2tdPwUPEYz6ExfbWubiXPB6daUuhJxikMEb4eXRp5oKZBKZwrbJ2k7EZe`.

We call these addresses _"Bootstrap addresses"_ or simply _"Byron addresses"_;
in contrast to other addresses that are either called _"addresses"_ or
_"Shelley addresses"_ when there's a possible ambiguity. Byron addresses are
considered deprecated today and are likely not something you want to use ever.
But, you might come across them, for some legacy systems still use them.

<Callout type="info">
Outputs locked by a Byron address or inputs corresponding to such outputs are
**forbidden** in transactions that have Plutus scripts! This means that
on-chain validators should never encounter Byron addresses in a validation
context. This used to be different in the early days of the Alonzo era but was
later changed to avoid hazardous situations.
</Callout>

## Validity Intervals

You probably know already that Cardano smart-contract execution is fully
deterministic.

This, however, raises an interesting question: **How to deal with time?**

Asking for _the current time_ usually breaks determinism because asking the
same question at different moments may lead to different answers and, thus,
different execution paths. So how to introduce time in scripts validating
transactions?

Cardano decouples transaction validations in two phases, and we typically refer
to them as "phase-1 validations" and "phase-2 validations". Phase-1 validations
are structural checks on a transaction performed by the ledger. For example,
this is when the ledger verifies that inputs referenced in a transaction are
valid, that minimum amounts for fees and outputs are met, etc...

Among the available features of a transaction are "validity intervals" that
define a period after which and until the ledger can consider the transaction
valid. The validity interval is made of a lower bound (optional) and an upper
bound (optional), and it is verified during phase-1 validations. That is if a
transaction is said to be valid only after the 5th January 2030, it can only be
submitted and considered valid by the ledger after that date. Similarly, if the
validity interval defines an upper bound, then the transaction will sit in
mempools until then. It is pruned if it doesn't make it into a block by the
specified date.

Thereby, one can introduce a notion of time in validators through the means of
validity intervals. Since they are checked during phase-1, a validator can
assume that the transaction it validates is within the specified validity
interval. Hence, should you ensure that an action happens only after a specific
date, you can record that date as a datum and check that the transaction's
lower bound is greater than the specified date.

The validity interval can be as narrow as one second, allowing scripts to run at
very thin precisions. However, a narrow interval means getting the
transaction in a block may be more difficult. As a reminder, there's one block
every 20 seconds on average minted on the Cardano blockchain. Blocks are
usually propagated fast, but it can take a few minutes under moments of heavy
load.

## Serialization strategies

There's no canonical serialization of objects on Cardano. While there is indeed
a CDDL specification for core objects<sup><a class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]" href="#cddl-files">see
below</a></sup>, as mentioned earlier, there are still multiple possible
interpretations possible of the specification. For example, a CDDL
specification is unable to express in what order should keys in a map be
serialized, or whether optional fields with default values (e.g. an optional
list of elements) should be omitted entirely or specified with an empty default
value.

While there are attempts, such as
[CIP-0021](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0021) to
agree on a canonical serialization; the current Cardano ledger does not provide
any such guarantee. Consequently, the recommended strategy when dealing with
deserialized objects that need to be reserialized is to always preserve the
original bytes and not attempt to reserialize anything. At the same time,
parsers should not assume one way over another and be ready to deserialize any
possible representation that is compliant with the CDDL specification.

This means, amongst other things, that there are multiple possible
serializations of a transaction, and it may lead to surprising situations when
trying to recalculate the hash of an object.

## Hash digests

Cardano uses mostly only blake2b as a hashing algorithm throughout the
chain. Saying "mostly" because we can find some examples of SHA-256 in some
parts of the Byron era, but let's not dwell on that.

Many things called `id` are hash digests of some serialized objects.
For example, a stake pool id is a hash digest of the pool
public cold key. A transaction id is a hash digest value of the serialized
transaction body. And so forth.

Hashes are generally 32-byte long on Cardano (or 256 bits), **except for
credentials** (i.e. keys or scripts) which are 28-byte long (or 224 bits). This
is why a policy id is only 28 bytes long: a policy id is the hash digest of
a tagged script, and scripts can be used as credentials (i.e. part of
an address). The same goes for any hash digest of a verification key.

## Policy Id and language tags

A policy id is a hash digest of a tagged script. Tagged is the keyword here.
Should you try to calculate the policy id by simply hashing a serialized
script, you may find yourself with a wrong hash without knowing why.

Raw scripts aren't exact pre-image of their hash digest. Before hashing,
scripts are prefixed with a certain discriminator byte depending on the
language. For instance, any native script is prefixed with a `0x00`
(`0b0000_0000`) byte before hashing.

Here's a table summarizing all discriminators:

| Language    | Discriminator Byte   |
| ---         | ---                  |
| `Native`    | `0x00`               |
| `Plutus V1` | `0x01`               |
| `Plutus V2` | `0x02`               |
| `Plutus V3` | `0x03`               |

The subsequent versions of Plutus may likely follow the pattern.

## Rewards & Withdrawals

Ouroboros, the consensus algorithm used by Cardano, defines an incentive
mechanism for stakeholders to participate in the consensus through rewards. Of
course, you probably know that by now. Rewards are paid every epoch to
delegators that delegate their stake (i.e. ADA tokens) to a stake pool of the
network producing blocks on their behalf. Those rewards are, however, not paid
directly to stakeholders; this would cause the network at every epoch boundary
to pay out all rewards.

Instead, Cardano has introduced a restricted concept of account, similar to
what exists on account-based ledgers. This account is, however, singular in
many ways:

- It is defined by some stake credentials and owned by them;
- It can only receive rewards from the protocol but not from a user-defined transaction;
- It is automatically delegated;

It is possible to withdraw funds from the account by issuing a withdrawal
(which takes the form of a specific field in a transaction). A withdrawal sets
the balance of an account to 0 and provides a virtual pot of the account value
to the transaction carrying it as if it was an input of that same value. That
value can then be dispatched in one or more UTxO, as typically done with
any input.

The stake credentials associated with the account protect withdrawals as well.
Who owns the stake credentials owns the right to withdraw from the account.
This means that reward withdrawals can be commanded by a script (and
thus an Aiken program).

## Native Scripts

Before full-blown Plutus scripts, Cardano had a minimalistic scripting language
usually referred to as _"Native Script"_ or _"Phase-1 scripts"_. It still
exists and provides simple, albeit useful, programmability features to Cardano.
Native scripts come in the form of a little domain-specific language with 6
constructors: `key`, `all-of`, `any-of`, `n-of-m`, `after` and `before`.

In particular, they are quite handy in defining multisig addresses owned by
multiple tenants. You can find more about native scripts in
[CIP-1854](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1854#overview)
and in the [Formal Ledger Specification, Figure 4: Multi-signature via Native
Scripts](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/releases/latest/download/shelley-ledger.pdf).

## The 'clean' trick: avoid replaying blocks

Sometimes, the Cardano node will perform a complete re-validation of the chain
as an integrity check. It does so by scanning through its local files, and
_replaying_ blocks onto each other. On Mainnet, this procedure can take
multiple hours and is caused, in principle, by mainly two things:

1. A restart after a non-clean shutdown of the node (e.g. a SIGKILL, or power outage);
2. A critical change in the ledger version.

The detection of the first scenario is sometimes a bit clunky, and the unlucky
ones amongst us have likely already experienced (sometimes several times) the
infamous:

```
Replayed block: slot 3844799 out of 112665654. Progress: 3.41%
Replayed block: slot 3844783 out of 112665654. Progress: 3.42%
...
```

It turns out that there exists a way to skip re-validations of the first kind.
Indeed, on start-up, the node will look for an empty file named `clean` at the
root of its database folder.

```
node.db/
├── clean              <------------ this fellow
├── immutable
├── ledger
├── lock
├── protocolMagicId
└── volatile
```

When present, the node will not replay blocks, unless it detects a critical
change in the ledger (second scenario) which happens fairly rarely. So it
suffices to create such a file (e.g. `touch node.db/clean` to avoid replaying
blocks unecessarily. This is a useful trick to use when developing with a local
node, but **totally unsound in a production setting** (especially for SPO).

## Transaction latency vs finality

In a distributed system like Cardano, the notion of _latency_ and _finality_
are often misunderstood (or swapped). Yet, it is crucial to get them right
especially when it comes to transactions.

Latency is the time it takes for a transaction to appear on the blockchain, in
a block. Finality is the time it takes for a transaction to become immutable
and permanent. Why is that different? Because the system is distributed! And
that means the information is only *eventually* true. How long is enough
depends on the interested parties and the type of transaction.

It is hard to give a definite answer because finality directly depends on the
proportion of adversarial stake in the system. And unfortunately, adversaries
don't walk the street waving their hands about the fact they are, in fact,
adversaries. If we call `ε` the proportion of adversaries (`[0;0.5]`), and consider `g`
their grinding power we find that under Ouroboros Praos (current Cardano
consensus algorithm), the *probability of settlement errors* in terms of the
number of blocks (`x`) is given by the following equation:

<img src="/settlement_error_probability.light.svg" class="light img-75" />
<img src="/settlement_error_probability.dark.svg"  class="dark  img-75" />

Now, what are good values for `ε` and `g` is hard to say. Regarding the
grinding power, values in the range of `10^9`..`10^10` are quite conservative
values. The entire Bitcoin network has a grinding power of about `10^12`. So
unless the entire Bitcoin network is attacking Cardano, `g` is likely smaller
than `10^12`. For the adversary proportion, as a rule of thumb, it's good to
look at the total stake of the largest stake pools to get an idea of how much
power can a single entity gather.

<img src="/settlement_error_probability.png" />

A good recommendation for sensitive transactions is thus to wait around 100-150
blocks (30-50 min) whereas a few blocks is usually sufficient for small
payments. If you want to play with the equation, feel free to look at
[this interactive calculator](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/rjttcxk8).

## Developer Portal

There exists plenty of resources available on Cardano. Though there are a bit
hard to find sometimes. As a rule of thumb (and unfortunately): avoid
http://docs.cardano.org as it is often inaccurate, plain wrong or missing
crucial elements.

On the other hand, the [Cardano Developer
Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/) is a good entry point to many of the
ecosystem tooling and resources. The "Builder Tools" section is particularly
furnished. It is community-maintained, curated and under constant evolution.
Feel free to contribute and ask questions there as well!
